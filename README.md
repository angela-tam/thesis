# thesis

This repository contains 
#### 1) A LaTeX CLS file 
* This class file contains a template for a thesis that (mostly) conforms to the requirements for a thesis for McGill University (at least back in 2018 when I wrote mine). This file basically defines the structure of the thesis.
#### 2) A .tex template
* A template to write or put the thesis together using the abovementioned class file.

If you'd like to check out a finalized thesis that was written with this template, click [here](http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=160752&silo_library=GEN01)

Happy writing! :)
