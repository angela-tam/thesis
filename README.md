# thesis

This repository contains 
#### 1) A LaTeX CLS file (MastersDoctoralThesis.cls)
* This class file contains a template for a thesis that conforms to the requirements for a thesis for McGill University (at least back in 2018 when I wrote mine). This file basically defines the structure of the thesis.
#### 2) A .tex template (main.tex)
* A template to write or put the entire thesis together using the abovementioned class file.
#### 3) An example for a single chapter (chapter_1_intro.tex)
* An example of how to write a chapter that would be inserted into the `main.tex`

For more detailed instructions on how to write with this class (and how to write in LaTeX generally), you can refer to [this template (see note below) on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-a-masters-slash-doctoral-thesis/mkzrzktcbzfl). 

If you'd like to check out a finalized thesis that was written with the template in this repo, click [here](http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=160752&silo_library=GEN01).

Happy writing! :)

- A template authored by Vel (vel@latextemplates.com) & Johannes Böttcher, who had derived their template from [Steve Gunn](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/srg/softwaretools/document/templates/) and [Sunil Patel](http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/thesis-template/)
